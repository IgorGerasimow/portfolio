## Summary

10+ Yr Multi-Cloud IT Pro | AWS Expert, Google | DevSecOps, GitOps, Platform Engine | | Skilled in cloud, containers, microservices | RTB, DeFiI am a passionate Python geek and DevOps engineer with over ten years of experience in software engineering and DevOps practices. My background in high-load distributed systems, microservices, monitoring, configuration, deployment, testing, and continuous integration has equipped me with strong technical and leadership skills. I thrive both as an individual contributor and a collaborative team player, consistently bringing diligence, dedication, and problem-solving prowess to every project.


Let me pass trought detailed tech examples of work I did before and activly working now: 
 - Platform design for modern aws based system, with advanced scaling, application design patterns, observability features and cloud native - https://github.com/IgorGerasimow/platform-design
 - How I see existing setup for EKS cluster in AWS - https://github.com/IgorGerasimow/platform-design/blob/main/docs/eks-cilium-istio-karpenter-cdk-manual.md
 - How I run bareMetal design kubernetes with support of flat network across cluster and multiple providers - https://github.com/IgorGerasimow/platform-design/blob/main/docs/eks-cilium-istio-karpenter-terragrunt-manual.md

  - Cloudflare - 3 years
  - OVH        - 5 years
  - Showflare  - 2 years 

- **Operating Systems and Execution environment:**  
  - Linux and bate-metals (Ubuntu/Debian preferred) – 10+ years
  - Kubernetes ( AKS, EKS, GKE, Typhoon, Kubespray )
  - AWS lambdas and GCP cloudFunctions

- **Container Orchestration:**  
  - Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, kops, kubespray) – 5 years  
  - Experience scaling clusters up to ~250 nodes as average clusters, with pike up to 3000+ nodes ( what i don't want to do anymore ) 
  - Familiar with KEDA, Karpenter, and AWS Scaler

- **Infrastructure as Code:**  
  - Terraform and Terragrunt – 6 years of day-to-day usage  
  - AWS CDK - 1 year
  - Emphasis on best practices: small changes, pull requests, logical module separation, and comprehensive documentation, ABAC and advanced security  
  - Developed both basic and complex modules (e.g., platforms integrating auth stacks with components like elastiCashe, Kubernetes apps, API gateways, and S3 storage)

- **Continuous Delivery & Automation:**  
  - Jenkins, GitLab-CI, ArgoCD, Flux – 6 years
    build microservices pipelines with several steps - build/test/deploy used ad SDLC alongsite with pipelines included unit/smoke/integrational tests with  preview environments and blue-green testings with hundreds services per cluster     
  - Ansible, Helm for deployment automation

- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Datadog, Prometheus + exporters, Telegraf, ELK stack, Grafana, VM stack
    Ideal solution would contain multiple layers of observability solution
    - kubernetes and 12-factor layer includes healthChecks, lifecycle policy, selfHealing, stop and start procedure, metrics exposure and tracing
    - infra layer - Datadog/Grafana CLoud/any other solution as observability for cloud provider and services, db load for example or ssl certificates expiration, network traffic etc
    - business level by used activity emulating with self made tool, this tool responding on main question - is app visible and working for user

- **Programming Languages:**  
  - Python and Golang

- **Queues:**
  - Kafka, Pulsar

- **Databases and datastorages:**
  - Postgres, Mysql, Mongodb, Aerospike

- **Secrets and Secutiry:**
  - Vault, ExternalSecretsOperator, 1password, sealed secrets and SOPS

- **Languages:**  
  - Fluent English; Ukrainian and Russian (native)
 
    

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Environment setup: bare metal, AWS, GCE  
- Automation of CI/CD pipelines and GitOps practices  
- Cloud and application architecture design  
- Implementation of robust security measures

## Experience

- **Project Architecture & Planning:**  
  Full design plan including 3 big pikes which intersect with each other and develop into and became foundation of Platform Engineering:
   -  unified infrastructure covering 13 internal subprojects ( startups ) with single infra setup, strict list of tools we can use and support. This pike includes kubernetes clusters design with QoS, scaling nodes and pods strategy, traffic management with Istio, network design with Cillium with L2 banancing
   -  unified delivery with application templates, this template incudes build and test ci pipeline, libraries and modules used internally, drivers for Postgre/mongo, examples of metrics and tracing for each app, procedure delivery triggered by PR and git tags
   - unified documentation covering whole processes how your code become a product through delivery, how add alermanager rules for tracking your app and whre  find  

- **Infrastructure Management:**  
  - Setting up and maintaining cloud environments and bare metal servers  
  - Operating system configuration and optimization

- **Consulting & Leadership:**  
  - Advising developer teams and leading hiring interviews  
  - Guiding teams through technology adoption and process improvements

- **Automation & Configuration:**
  - Deploying cloud-native and 12-factor ready applications
  - Implementing and optimizing delivery processes and automation frameworks

- **Team Management:**
  - Built strong horizontal connections between DevOps and development teams through regular collaboration sessions.
  - Created personalized growth plans for engineers to encourage professional development and knowledge sharing.
  - Organized short-term sprint goals while maintaining alignment with long-term technical roadmaps.
  - Led the hiring process from screening to onboarding, ensuring smooth integration of new team members.
  - Maintained open communication channels and regular check-ins to keep teams aligned and motivated.
  - Fostered a culture of continuous improvement and ownership across the organization.
