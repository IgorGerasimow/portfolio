          This is an alert meant to ensure that the entire alerting pipeline is functional.
          This alert is always firing, therefore it should always be firing in Alertmanager
          and always fire against a receiver. There are integrations with various notification
          mechanisms that send a notification when this alert is not firing. For example the
          "DeadMansSnitch" integration in PagerDuty.
        runbook_url: https://runbooks.prometheus-operator.dev/runbooks/general/watchdog
        summary: An alert that should always be firing to certify that Alertmanager is working properly.
