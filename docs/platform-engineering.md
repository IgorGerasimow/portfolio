Platform Engineering: Components, Plan, Org & Tech Choices

Key Components of Platform Engineering
	•	IDP / Golden Paths: service templates, pipelines, runtime defaults, self-service environments.
	•	GitOps Delivery: desired state repos, progressive delivery, environment promotion.
	•	Runtime & Scheduling: Kubernetes (+ KubeVirt for VMs), multi-cluster, tenancy, QoS, capacity.
	•	Infrastructure as Code: Terraform/Terragrunt + Ansible, immutable infra, drift detection.
	•	Observability & SLOs: Prometheus/OTel/Loki/Tempo + SLO/error budgets + runbooks.
	•	Policy & Security: OPA/Kyverno, SBOMs, image signing (cosign), secrets mgmt, SLSA supply chain.
	•	Networking & Storage: CNI (Cilium), eBPF, BGP/EVPN, Ceph/Rook, backup/restore.
	•	CI/CD & DevX: one primary CI system, ephemeral envs, contract tests, DX metrics (TTFD, NPS).
	•	Governance: ADR/RFCs, RACI, architecture review, FinOps tagging/budgets.
	•	Knowledge & Enablement: docs-as-code, playbooks, office hours, gamedays.

Short Plan (CloudLinux-tailored)
	1.	Stabilize & assess current stack; remove top incident sources; document SPOFs.
	2.	Pick the lane: converge toolchain (one Git host/CI, one IaC flow, one GitOps engine).
	3.	Platform contract v1: service template + CI + runtime defaults + SLO pack.
	4.	IaC baseline: move core infra to Terraform/Terragrunt; target >60% coverage.
	5.	Bootstrap GitOps with Argo CD/Flux for a pilot product; enable progressive delivery.
	6.	Runtime modernization: Kubernetes core; pilot KubeVirt to absorb VM workloads.
	7.	Observability & SLOs for core services; enforce error-budget policy.
	8.	Security baseline: SBOMs, signing, admission policies.
	9.	Org & mindset: platform guild, golden paths, office hours; measure DX & DORA.
	10.	Scale & de-risk: retire legacy incrementally; run gamedays; reduce bus-factor.

Detailed Plan (Phased)

Phase 0–1: Stabilize & Assess (2–6 weeks)
	•	Map dependencies, identify “bus factor = 1” areas and legacy bottlenecks.
	•	Quick wins: alert hygiene, top-5 runbooks, VM cleanup automation.
	•	Set north-star metrics: DORA, % IaC, % GitOps adoption, SLO coverage, MTTR.
	•	Form Platform Core (2–3 senior engineers + Infra Director) and define RACI.

Phase 2: Foundation (6–12 weeks)
	•	Tooling convergence: select primary Git host & CI; standardize runners; author CI archetypes.
	•	IaC baseline: Terraform/Terragrunt structure (org/env/app), state backends, policy checks; reach 40–60% coverage.
	•	GitOps bootstrap: Argo CD/Flux manages cluster add-ons + 1–2 pilot services; env repos & promotion flow.
	•	Observability pack: Prometheus + OTel + Loki/Tempo, Grafana dashboards; SLI/SLOs for core services.
	•	Security pack: SBOM (Syft), vuln scan (Grype/Trivy), cosign signing, OPA/Kyverno, External Secrets.

Phase 3: Transform (3–6 months)
	•	Runtime modernization: Kubernetes default; expand KubeVirt to shrink legacy VM platform reliance; Ceph via Rook; networking underlay integration.
	•	IDP (Internal Dev Platform): Backstage catalog + golden-path templates (service, job, helm chart, pipeline, SLO, policy).
	•	Delivery excellence: progressive delivery (Argo Rollouts), contract tests, ephemeral envs per PR, orchestrated releases.
	•	Resilience engineering: incident workflow, error budgets, blameless postmortems, scheduled gamedays.

Phase 4: Scale & Optimize (ongoing)
	•	Legacy retirement: stepwise migration off legacy VM/orchestration and old CI tools.
	•	Multi-cloud/DC posture: standardized clusters across DCs and clouds; FinOps tagging/budgets for cost control.
	•	DX & adoption: platform NPS, Time-to-First-Deploy, golden-path coverage; office hours & enablement.

⸻

Mindset Transformation
	•	Heroics → Guardrails: policies & templates make “right easy, wrong hard.”
	•	Tickets → Self-Service: teams own deploys; platform owns rails.
	•	Ad-hoc fixes → SLO/Error Budgets: protect capacity for improvement work.
	•	Tool sprawl → Product thinking: one paved road, versioned platform, roadmap & feedback loops.
	•	Oral tradition → Docs-as-code: runbooks, ADRs, playbooks in repos.

Levers: exec sponsorship, platform champions in product squads, weekly office hours, RFC process, public scorecards, gamedays.

⸻

Team Structure

Initial
	•	Platform Core: 2–3 senior engineers + Infrastructure Director leading the change.

Target Squads
	•	Platform Core (K8s/KubeVirt): cluster platform, tenancy, upgrades.
	•	Infra & NetOps: Terraform/Terragrunt, data centers, networking.
	•	DevEx/CI/CD: golden paths, runners, ephemeral envs, Backstage.
	•	SRE/Observability: SLOs, reliability reviews, incident mgmt.
	•	Security (DevSecOps): supply-chain, policies, secrets, compliance.
	•	Storage & Data: Ceph/Rook, backup/restore, data SLOs.

Cross-cutting: Architecture Review Board, Platform Guild, FinOps.
Remote-first: async docs, design docs before work, quarterly platform roadmap.

⸻

Company Structure & Governance
	•	RACI: Platform (Responsible) for rails; product teams (Accountable) for service health/SLOs.
	•	ADRs/RFCs: required for non-standard tech choices.
	•	Service catalog & scorecards: visibility for leadership (SLOs, cost, on-call, risk).
	•	Funding model: platform OKRs tied to DORA/SLO/Cost KPIs.

⸻

Git Strategy
	•	Trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches, required reviews & checks, protected main.
	•	Versioning & releases:
	•	Apps/Services: SemVer tags, immutable images; release branches only for LTS/security.
	•	Infra: environment directories (live/dev/stage/prod) with promotion via PR; avoid long-lived env branches.
	•	Repo split (“3-repo model”):
	1.	App Source: code, Docker, tests.
	2.	Ops/Manifests (GitOps): Helm/Kustomize, Argo CD per environment.
	3.	Infra (Terraform/Terragrunt): accounts/projects, networks, clusters.
	•	Ephemeral envs per PR: preview namespaces + temporary DNS.
	•	Compliance gates: policy-as-code, SBOM/signing in CI; controlled prod change approvals.

⸻

Technology Stack (Target)
	•	Compute/Runtime: Kubernetes (multi-cluster), KubeVirt for VM workloads; node pools & PriorityClasses.
	•	Storage: Ceph via Rook; snapshots; Velero for DR.
	•	Networking: Cilium (eBPF), BGP/EVPN; Ingress (NGINX or Envoy).
	•	Git & CI/CD: converge to GitHub + Actions (or GitLab CI if dominant); runners on K8s; Argo CD/Argo Rollouts for GitOps/progressive delivery.
	•	IaC: Terraform + Terragrunt; Ansible for config; drift detection (Atlantis/Spacelift/Terraform Cloud).
	•	Observability: Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Loki, Tempo, Grafana; Alertmanager; SLO tooling (Sloth/Pyrra).
	•	Security: Sigstore/cosign, Trivy/Grype, Syft (SBOM), OPA/Kyverno, External Secrets, Vault or cloud KMS; SLSA levels.
	•	DevX/IDP: Backstage catalog, Cookiecutter/Plop templates, service scorecards.
	•	Cloud/DC: multiple DCs + AWS/GCP/Azure managed via IaC and GitOps.

⸻

Risks & Mitigations
	•	Change fatigue / resistance: exec sponsorship, visible quick wins, champions program.
	•	Legacy coupling: KubeVirt bridge strategy; dual-run, phased retirement.
	•	Bus factor: rotate ownership, pair on-call, codified runbooks, mandatory ADRs.
	•	Tooling fragmentation: time-boxed consolidation; freeze net-new tools until convergence.
	•	Operational risk: progressive delivery, canaries, automated rollbacks, gamedays.

⸻

What to Measure (Quarterly)
	•	DORA: deploy frequency, lead time, MTTR, change-fail rate.
	•	Coverage: % IaC, % GitOps, % services on golden path.
	•	Reliability: SLO attainment, error-budget burn.
	•	DX: Time-to-First-Deploy, platform NPS.
	•	Cost: tagged spend, idle %, egress.
